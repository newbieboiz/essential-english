# Lesson 3: I'm good at

Again, "I'm" is used here as "I am".
"Good at" informs someone what you excel at and are comfortable doing.

Here are some examples:

- "I'm good at drawing."
- "I'm good at video games."
- "I'm good at swimming."
- "I'm good at driving."
- "I'm good at reading."
- "I'm good at sports."
- "I'm good at writing."
- "I'm good at math."
- "I'm good at dancing."
- "I'm good at chess."
