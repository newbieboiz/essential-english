# Lesson 23: I can't help + (verb-ing)

The word "can't" is contraction for "cannot". Combined with "help" you are communicating something
you are unable to control or having a hard time gaining a grasp for. This can be a physical or mental action.

Here are some examples:

- "I can't help thinking about it."
- "I can't help shopping so much."
- "I can't help working all the time."
- "I can't help smiling when I see her."
- "I can't help eating so much."
- "I can't help loving you."
- "I can't help biting my nails when I am nervous."
- "I can't help smocking when I have been drinking."
- "I can't help feeling so sad."
- "I can't help remembering the things you did."
