# Lesson 24: I was busy + (verb-ing)

When using the word "was", you are referring to something in a past tense, or something that happened before.
Combining it with the word 'busy' you can express something that was occupying you in a past time.

Here are some examples:

- "I was busy thinking."
- "I was busy working."
- "I was busy cooking dinner."
- "I was busy talking on the phone."
- "I was busy cleaning the house."
- "I was busy studying for my test."
- "I was busy thinking of ideas for our website."
- "I was busy completing my housework."
- "I was busy learning new things."

By changing "was" to "am" you change your message from past tense to present tense and refer to something you are doing "now".

Here are some examples:

- "I am busy working."
- "I am busy cooking dinner."
- "I am busy studying for my test."
- "I am busy completing housework."
- "I am busy talking on the phone."
