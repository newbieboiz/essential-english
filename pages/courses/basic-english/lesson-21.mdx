# Lesson 21: I'd rather + (verb)

"I'd" is a contraction of the words "I had" or "I would".
When using it with the word "rather" you are suggesting you would like to do or prefer one thing more than another.

Here are some examples:

- "I'd rather talk about this later."
- "I'd rather eat at home than go get fast food."
- "I'd rather stay late than come in early tomorrow."
- "I'd rather handle the problem myself."
- "I'd rather go home than stay out too late."
- "I'd rather exercise than sit on the couch al day."
