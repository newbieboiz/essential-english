# Lesson 22: I'd feel like + (verb-ing)

Here you are expressing to someone something you would enjoy doing.

Here are some examples:

- "I feel like going to the beach."
- "I feel like having a snack."
- "I feel like talking."
- "I feel like dancing."
- "I feel like having friends over to my house."
- "I feel like watching TV."

By adding "don't" or "do not" you can change what you are saying
to express something you would not enjoy or express a concern about something.

Here are some examples:

- "I don't feel like leaving yet."
- "I don't feel like explaining."
- "I don't feel like going to bed."
- "I don't feel comfortable talking about it."
- "I don't feel like we are going in the right direction."
