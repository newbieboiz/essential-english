# Lesson 9: I'm have + (past participle)

Again, "I have" shows possession or something acquired.
By adding a past participle you are informing someone of a past
or completed action done by you.

Here are some examples:

- "I have done it."
- "I have heard that before."
- "I have driven a car."
- "I have forgotten the words."
- "I have read that book."
- "I have eaten at that restaurant before."
- "I have flown in an airplane."
- "I have forgiven you."
- "I have seen you before."
- "I have written a letter."
