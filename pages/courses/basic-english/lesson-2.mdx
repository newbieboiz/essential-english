# Lesson 2: I'm in/at/on

Describes an action you are doing.

Most commonly, you would use the word 'in' when entering a physical location
such as a room or a building.

Here are some examples:

- "I'm in the shower."
- "I'm in the lobby."
- "I'm a car."
- "I'm a house."
- "I'm a school."

Using the word 'at' helps tell someone where you currently are. The difference between 'at' and 'in' is that the physical location is general.

Here are some examples:

- "I'm at the grocery."
- "I'm at the mall."
- "I'm at the doctor's office."
- "I'm at the park."
- "I'm at the airport."

However, in some cases you can use 'at' and 'in' interchangeably.

Here are some examples:

- "I'm at the mall."
- "I'm in the mall."
- "I'm at the park."
- "I'm in the park."
- "I'm at the grocery."
- "I'm in the grocery."

Using the word "on" is referring to a non physical location such as your time being utilized by something else.

Here are some examples:

- "I'm on the phone."
- "I'm on my computer."
- "I'm on a bus."
