# Lesson 19: I don't have time to + (verb)

The word "don't" is a contraction of the words "do not".
When adding "have time to", you are simply stating that you have other obligations
and all other things considered must wait.

Here are some examples:

- "I don't have time to explain."
- "I don't have time to eat."
- "I don't have time to exercise."
- "I don't have time to watch my favorite TV show."
- "I don't have time to talk."

You can also use the phrase "I don't" to express things you do not like,
things you do not understand, or things you do not do.

Here are some examples:

- "I don't eat meat."
- "I don't like the rain."
- "I don't understand Spanish."
- "I don't like scary movies."
- "I don't like sports."
